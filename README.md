## Development server

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via Jest

## User Manual

Once the application is launched on `http://localhost:4200/`, you can start testing it by adding new bidders:

- For each new addition, you need to provide their name and the bid amount.
- Once the new bidder's data is entered, click the "Add" button.

**NB: You can add multiple bidders and even add multiple bid amounts for the same bidder.**

- Once the list of bidders is completed, you must provide a reserve price (it must be > 0).

- When the reserve price is provided, click on "Calculate Auction" to determine which bidder has won the auction.

- The name and the winning bid amount will then be displayed on the screen.

**A demo will also be available in the repository.**
